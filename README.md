# DailyMeals
DailyMeals is a service that prepares and delivers fresh meals to people who want convenient, healthy food without having to cook every day. Customers can subscribe to weekly meal plans or order meals whenever they want. The goal of the system is to make the entire experience smooth — from choosing meals, to preparing them in the kitchen, to getting them delivered on time.

DailyMeals has several types of users:
- Customers, who look at the weekly menu, pick their meals, pay, and track deliveries.
- Kitchen staff, who see what meals need to be cooked each day and how many portions to prepare.
- Delivery drivers, who get their assigned routes and confirm when meals have been delivered.
- Administrators, who manage the menu, update prices, review orders, and handle issues.

Because all these people interact with the system differently, DailyMeals provides several different interfaces: a website or app for customers, internal dashboards for the kitchen and admin teams, and a simple mobile view for drivers.

The system also connects with outside services to handle things like payments, sending email or text updates, and mapping routes for deliveries.

Behind the scenes, DailyMeals keeps track of customers, meals, orders, ingredients, weekly menus, and delivery schedules. Some tasks happen automatically — like generating the list of meals the kitchen must prepare each morning, charging weekly subscribers, or sending notifications as meals move through the delivery process.

Overall, DailyMeals is meant to represent a realistic, modern application: one that has multiple user roles, several parts working together, and real-world challenges like timing, coordination, and communication between different teams. The project will explore how to design this system in a clear and organized way so each part fits together smoothly.
